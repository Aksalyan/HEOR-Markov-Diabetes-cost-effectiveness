Cost-effectiveness analysis of empagliflozin vs sitagliptin using a Markov model (Indian payer perspective)

Objective
To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin compared with sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus from an Indian payer perspective.

Model Overview
Perspective: Indian healthcare payer,
Time horizon: 10 years,
Cycle length: 1 year,
Discount rate: 3% annually,

Health states:
Controlled diabetes,
Diabetes with complications,
Death,

Methods
A cohort Markov model was developed in Microsoft Excel to simulate disease progression, costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).

Results
Empagliflozin was associated with lower costs and higher QALYs compared with sitagliptin and was therefore dominant.
